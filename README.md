# Prevent-Food-Waste-Website
How to Prevent Food Waste – Informational Simple Responsive Website built with HTML &amp; CSS

This project is a multi-page informational website focused on raising awareness about how to prevent food waste. Created as part of the BATECH 189 coursework, the website educates users on the impact of food waste and provides practical solutions individuals can apply in their daily lives.
The website includes:
Home Page – Introduces the issue of food waste and its environmental and social impact
About Page – Explains the purpose of the project and why reducing food waste matters
Resources Page – Shares helpful tips, tools, and external resources to support food waste prevention
The project emphasizes clear content structure, user navigation, and accessibility, using semantic HTML and CSS styling to create an easy-to-understand and informative user experience. It reflects my interest in combining digital communication, education, and web development to promote meaningful social and environmental causes.
